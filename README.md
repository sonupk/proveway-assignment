Setup and Dependencies:

Make sure you have Node.js installed, and set up two Google Drive API projects (one for the source and one for the destination). You'll need to enable the Google Drive API for both projects and obtain API credentials (client ID and secret).

You'll also need the following Node.js libraries:

express for creating the API endpoints.
googleapis for interacting with Google Drive API.
axios for making HTTP requests.
Authentication:

Set up authentication using OAuth 2.0 with the Google Drive API for both the source and destination projects. Save the authentication tokens for later use.
